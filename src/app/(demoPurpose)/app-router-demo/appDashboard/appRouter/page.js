      <h1>Key functions of an app router include:</h1>
  <p><strong>Routing:</strong> It determines the appropriate destination for incoming requests based on predefined routes or patterns. This routing logic often involves matching URLs or request parameters to specific handlers or controllers within the application.</p>
  <p><strong>Middleware handling:</strong> App routers commonly support middleware, allowing developers to inject additional processing logic into the request-response cycle. Middleware functions may perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or error handling.</p>
  <p><strong>Request handling:</strong> Once a request is routed to the appropriate destination, the app router facilitates the execution of the corresponding logic or functionality. This may involve invoking controller methods, rendering views, or serving static assets.</p>
  <p><strong>Error handling:</strong> App routers often include mechanisms for handling errors or exceptions that occur during request processing. They may provide default error handlers or allow developers to define custom error-handling logic.</p>
